We decided to move the website over to Jekyll. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and the Liquid renderer.

It then spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which makes it suitable for a project like Anoncoin.

Using Jekyll it is easy for people to make changes to this website by making a pull request on Github. Project maintainers can then easily see what changes have been made and merge them into the main repository and update the website.
