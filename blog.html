<!-- This loops through the paginated posts -->
Here are the blog posts, they are nice...<br>


<h3>Posts here</h3>
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
  </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
<br>

Remember to add some pagination too, pagination is nice...
<div>
  Also maybe some excerpts of the blog posts?
