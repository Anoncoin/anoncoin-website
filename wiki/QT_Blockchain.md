Open Bounty
-----------

**Short description:** Add a simple blockchain explorer to the Anoncoin-QT client

**Amount:** 300 ANC

**Details**

The Anoncoin-QT client provides a list of all transactions that are associated with the private addresses in the client's wallet. Since the client downloads the entire blockchain, it should be possible to search for other transactions, or to check balances of other ANC addresses.

The objective of this bounty is to add a new tab entitled something like “Search blockchain” or “Transaction explorer” to the Anoncoin-QT client. From this tab, it should be possible to search for a given transaction ID or ANC public address. The output should be similar to what is found on the blockchain explorer [ancblockchain.com](http://ancblockchain.com/).

Payout of this bounty will occur when the simple blockchain explorer is operational in the Jenkins weekly builds of the Anoncoin client.
