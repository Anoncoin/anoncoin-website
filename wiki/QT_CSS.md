Open Bounty
-----------

**Short description:** Contest for the best Anoncoin Qt wallet themes

**Amount:** 100 ANC for each of the best three designs.

**Details**

The Anoncoin Qt wallet now has the capability to choose among several different themes that change the look and feel of the wallet. We have created three test themes to demonstrate how this works, and here we are announcing a contest for the best three community-contributed themes that we will bundle with our next release.

Given the history of anoncoin, we are specifically interested in the following three themes:

1.  Anoncoin - A theme that is based on the retro minimal branding as found on our current [web site](https://anoncoin.net).
2.  Anonymous - A theme that exemplifies the ideals of the group *Anonymous*.
3.  I2P - A theme that is based on the branding of the I2P network.

For each theme that we select, we will pay a bounty of 100 ANC (or more, if we receive more contributions to our donation address). Honorable mentions that are not selected will be posted for download on our web site.

In order to use themes, you will need to either compile the “develop-themes” branch on github, or download one of the developer builds [from our web site](https://anoncoin.net/downloads/develop/) (at this point, only OSX and win64 developer builds are available). Next, you will need to copy the themes folder (found in share/qt) to your Anoncoin data directory. To create your own theme, simply create a new folder in the themes folder, and create a style.qss file that is based on one of the examples. To select the theme, go to Preferences &gt; Display, choose the theme from the drop down menu, and click OK. Further instructions on how to design themes can be found here: [Creating themes](/Creating_themes "wikilink").
