Central Banking
---------------

To learn about how central banking came about, and why we need a different system, here are a couple of good places to start:

### The Money Masters

A classic 3.5 hour video directed by Bill Still. Don't let the crappy production aesthetics fool you!

### The Secret of Oz

This is Bill Still's update to *The Money Masters*. It is pretty much the same movie, but shorter, and with better (but still bad) production qualities.

### Jekyll Island: The Truth Behind the Federal Reserve

Another Bill Still movie dedicated to the founding of the current central bank of the United States.

### [Web of Debt](http://www.webofdebt.com/)

A detailed book written by Ellen Hodgson Brown about fractional reserve banking and the history of central banking.
