The Anoncoin Main Network ID or Magic Number is: *FACABADA*.

The Magic Value is the first string in Anoncoin network messages. It indicates the message origin network, and is used to seek to the next message when the stream state is unknown.

This has been defined in [main.cpp line \#3213](https://github.com/Anoncoin/anoncoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L3213) in the Anoncoin source code.
