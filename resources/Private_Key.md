Every [Anoncoin address](/Anoncoin_Address) has a private key, which is required used to spend the anoncoins associated with the public key. The private key can be used to create the associated anoncoin public address, but the reverse can not be done. The private key must be kept secure to avoid theft of anoncoins.
