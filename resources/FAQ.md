What is Anoncash?
------------------------------------------------
Anoncash is the next generation of private digital cash, created by the Anoncoin core team. Basically, Anoncoin will cease to exist once Anoncash is released. Anoncash will be given to Anoncoin holders in a certain ratio yet to be decided.

What is a hardfork?
------------------------------------------------

A hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain, and nodes running previous versions will no longer be accepted by the newest version. This requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. Anoncoin has had several hardforks over the years. The last hardfork is at block 871111 when PoW is changed from Scrypt to GOST R 34.11-2012. 

Do I need to do anything before a hardfork?
------------------------------------------------

If you have your coins in the official wallet or in cold storage, like on a paper wallet, you do not have to do anything. If you have them on an exchange, you need to check that the exchange will upgrade to the new version of Anoncoin. For the hardfork at 871111 FreiExchange, NovaExchange and MiraiExchange have all upgraded.

Is Anoncoin related to the Anonymous collective?
------------------------------------------------

No, Anoncoin is not directly related to the Anonymous collective. Anoncoin can be used by anyone who values privacy and anonymity, including those associated with “Anonymous”. Some people involved with Anoncoin might be involved with Anonymous, but even if this were the case, this is irrelevant. The original Anoncoin logo of the headless businessman that is usually associated with the Anonymous collective has since been changed in order to distinguish the two entities.

What is the current block reward, and when will it halve?
---------------------------------------------------------

The current block reward is 1.25 ANC. This is expected to halve sometime in 2018, unless Anoncash is released before this date. We will then update this information.


Aren't all internet based peer to peer currencies anonymous?
------------------------------------------------------------

There are many coins and services that provide increased privacy (using such things as CoinJoin, SharedCoin, DarkSend, other coin mixing services and ring signatures), however, you should not confuse *privacy* with *anonymity*.
