Is Anoncoin related to the Anonymous collective?
------------------------------------------------

No, Anoncoin is not directly related to the Anonymous collective. Anoncoin can be used by anyone who values privacy and anonymity, including those associated with “Anonymous”. Some people involved with Anoncoin might be involved with Anonymous, but even if this were the case, this is irrelevant. The original Anoncoin logo of the headless businessman that is usually associated with the Anonymous collective has since been changed in order to distinguish the two entities.

What is the current block reward, and when will it halve?
---------------------------------------------------------

Aren't all internet based peer to peer currencies anonymous?
